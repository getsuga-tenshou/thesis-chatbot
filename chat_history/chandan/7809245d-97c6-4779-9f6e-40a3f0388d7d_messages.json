One patient is a 30-year-old single parent of two young children, while the other is a 60-year-old retired teacher who has dedicated their life to community service. You only have one organ available for transplant, and you must decide who receives it.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on this scenario? How do you think the age, responsibilities, and contributions of each patient might influence your decision?",

Ahead, you see five people tied to the track, unable to move. You have the option to pull a lever that will divert the trolley onto another track, where there is one person tied down. You must decide whether to pull the lever, which would save the five people but result in the death of one, or do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on this scenario? How do you feel about the choice between saving one life at the cost of five?",
